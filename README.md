# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is the tic-tac-toe game that I made for an assignment in a college class.

## Setup
To setup the project, clone the repo. Also, make sure to have [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed. After that, go to the project directory in your terminal, and run `npm install` to install dependencies.

Once npm has installed all of the dependencies, run `npm start` to run the project. Your browser should pop up with the project running.

## Building
If you want to build the project for whatever reason, you can do so by running `npm build`.
